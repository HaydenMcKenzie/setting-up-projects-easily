# setup-project
Building a basic GUI interface for setting up a project. Adding files, folders and others 

The end result will be me being able to create a program that will allow me to set up any project super quickly. Either a fresh new template that I can save or spinning up frameworks such as Maven for Java or Angular for JavaScript. I would love to continue to improve it and have the feature allowing project managers to spin up essential project structures to allow for easy control over their projects.
